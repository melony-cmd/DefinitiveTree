A definitive tree, no fuss no garbage straight to the point tree example:

Reason for the project is I am entirely annoyed / fustrated at the lack of focus on this widget, to the point that others are either reinventing the wheel of what is already available by mashing other widgets together creating an unholy mess or creating TreeViews that work but have so much bloat you don't know what is going on.
